# genealogy
A C++ project I did when I was 16, with the purpose of recording one's family tree. (ASCII user interface)

Purely text-based, there are no dependencies.

### Comments

The code needs restucturing: in particular, 16-y.o. me put class and function code into header files, rather than into separate source files with corresponding header files.  
The program does not save.
